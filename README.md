## Abstract 
Our overarching question was "Which neighborhood is the most invariant to an alien invasion?" We divided an alien invasion into 3 categories: running away from aliens, setting up camp from aliens, and defending ourselves from aliens. In order to accomplish this, we used the number of stairways in each neighborhood to determine how easy it was to run away and how many speed humps were in each neighborhood to determine how much the aliens would be slowed down. The more stairways there were, the worse we ranked the neighborhood. The more speed humps there were, the lower we ranked the neighborhood. For setting up camp, we used the total amount of playing field area in each neighborhood, with the more area the better the neighborhood. Lastly, for protecting ourselves, we measured how many gun seizures there were with the more gun seizures the better we ranked the neighborhood. We normalized each metric and added them all together and got Carrick as the most alien invasion invariant neighborhood.
